# 📊 IBM HR Attrition Analysis: Why Gen Z Stays or Leaves

This project explores the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset to investigate a key business question:

> **"What are the reasons why Gen Z employees stay or leave a company?"**

It forms part of my data analytics portfolio and demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Excel, SQL, and Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify what factors contribute to Gen Z (employees aged ~18–28) staying or leaving a company, by analyzing attributes like:

- Job Role  
- Overtime  
- Monthly Income  
- Education Field  
- Work-Life Balance  
- Years at Company  
- Environment Satisfaction  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

- **Excel**: Pivot tables, summary charts, attrition breakdown  
- **SQL**: Aggregations, filtering, grouping by age ranges and attrition  
- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data cleaning and EDA  
- **GitHub**: Version control and documentation  

---

## ❓ Key Questions Explored

- What percentage of Gen Z employees left the company?  
- Which departments or job roles have the highest attrition among Gen Z?  
- Is there a correlation between overtime and Gen Z attrition?  
- Do income levels or work-life balance affect whether Gen Z employees stay?  
- Can we identify early warning signs for potential Gen Z attrition?  

---

## 📌 Insights (to be updated as analysis progresses)

> ✳️ Example: Gen Z employees working overtime have a 2x higher attrition rate than those who don’t.

> ✳️ Example: Those with lower Environment Satisfaction scores are more likely to leave, especially in Sales and Technical roles.

(*More insights to be added in final report.*)
